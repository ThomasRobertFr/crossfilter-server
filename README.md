# Crossfilter server

**Crossfilter server** is a JavaScript class that implements the interfaces of [crossfilter](https://github.com/square/crossfilter) but uses an OLAP server thanks to a JavaScript API following the specifications of [Javascript Query API for OLAP](https://github.com/loganalysis/mandoline/wiki/Javascript-Query-API-for-OLAP) to compute filters and agregates on an OLAP cube.
