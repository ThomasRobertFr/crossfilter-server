# Crossfilter server

**Crossfilter server** is a JavaScript class that implements the interfaces of [crossfilter](https://github.com/square/crossfilter) but uses [solap4py](https://github.com/loganalysis/solap4py) (through [solap4py-js](https://github.com/loganalysis/solap4py-js)) to compute filters and agregates on an OLAP cube.
